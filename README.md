# Welcome to my 6502 Project!

This repo contains various assembly files written to run on a 6502 microprocessor. They can be compiled using the vasm compiler which I have included in the repo.

I am learning all this from [Ben Eater's YouTube series](https://www.youtube.com/c/BenEater), please check him out!

## counter.s 
This is a simple program that counts and displays the number of times the processor handles an interrupt request.

## message.s 
This program simply displays an ASCII string to the display.
![Example Output](https://github.com/Aurux/6502/blob/main/message.jpg?raw=true)

## text_editor.s 
This is still a work in progress but I would eventually like to be able to type text onto the display using the 4 input buttons.
